# Using OpenAI Models

Open-Inspect supports OpenAI Codex models in addition to Anthropic Claude models. This guide covers
how to configure your deployment to use them.

OpenAI subscriptions are managed as installation-wide provider accounts. Sessions and automations
can use the installation default, select a specific account, or explicitly use API-key mode.

## Supported Models

See [Available Models — OpenAI](AVAILABLE_MODELS.md#openai) for supported model IDs, reasoning
effort options, and defaults.

## Setup

There are three ways to pay for OpenAI models:

| Secrets                                      | Billing                                               | Setup                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_OAUTH_*` (ChatGPT Plus/Pro)          | Included in the subscription; fails at its quota      | [Steps 1–3](#step-1-connect-chatgpt)                             |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                             | Metered, per token                                    | [Using an API key](#using-an-api-key)                            |
| `OPENAI_OAUTH_*` + `OPENAI_API_KEY_FALLBACK` | Subscription up to a ceiling you choose, then metered | [Spilling over](#spilling-over-before-the-subscription-runs-out) |

### Step 1: Connect ChatGPT

1. Open **Settings > Provider Accounts**.
2. Choose **Add account > ChatGPT**. Device authorization starts automatically.
3. Use **Open ChatGPT Settings** and enable device code authorization for Codex.
4. Use **Open Device Authorization**, then enter the code shown by Open-Inspect when OpenAI asks for
   it.
5. Keep the dialog open while Open-Inspect waits for authorization. The new account appears after
   OpenAI confirms the connection.

Open-Inspect creates the account as **ChatGPT account** by default. Use **Rename** afterward if you
want a different display name. Provider accounts are shared by all admitted users in this
single-tenant deployment; they are not repository-scoped or private to their creator.

### Step 2: Configure Defaults

In the OpenAI section of **Settings > Provider Accounts**:

1. Choose the **Default account** used when an interactive session follows provider policy.
2. Choose **Unattended mode**:
   - **Use default account** makes Slack, GitHub, Linear, and unpinned automation runs use the
     subscription account.
   - **Use API key** keeps unattended launches on the existing API-key path.

Defaults are resolved when a session starts. Changing them does not move a running session to a
different paid account.

### Step 3: Select Authentication

Choose an OpenAI model when creating a session and use the **OpenAI authentication** selector to
choose provider policy, a specific connected account, or **Use API key**. Account mode overrides
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for that session.

Automation editors expose the same choices for every subscription provider. **Use defaults when each
run starts** resolves current policy for every run; selecting an account or API-key mode pins that
choice for future runs.

## Using an API key

Instead of a ChatGPT subscription, add a single secret on the **Settings** page:

| Secret Name      | Value                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | A key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (`sk-proj-...`) |

Global scope makes every session use it; repository or environment scope narrows it to one target.
All OpenAI models in the dropdown — including the Codex variants — are available this way, billed to
the key's project.

**An API key wins over the managed subscription.** When a session can see `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the
control plane skips OAuth broker mode for OpenAI, so the sandbox talks to `api.openai.com` with the
key. The `OPENAI_OAUTH_*` secrets can stay in place; delete the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret to switch
back to the subscription. The same precedence applies to xAI (`XAI_API_KEY` over SuperGrok OAuth).

Unlike the OAuth path, the key itself is injected into the sandbox environment, because OpenCode
reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly.

## Spilling over before the subscription runs out

A ChatGPT subscription that hits its Codex quota fails the session outright:
`Execution failed: The usage limit has been reached...`. To keep working on a per-token key — and,
if you want, to stop Open-Inspect from eating the whole subscription in the first place — add:

| Secret Name                       | Value                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY_FALLBACK`         | A platform API key, used only as a spillover                              |
| `OPENAI_SUBSCRIPTION_MAX_PERCENT` | Optional share of a rate-limit window sandboxes may consume (default 100) |

Keep the `OPENAI_OAUTH_*` secrets in place and do **not** set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (that would switch
every call to metered billing). Set `OPENAI_SUBSCRIPTION_MAX_PERCENT` to `80` to reserve the last
fifth of each window for whoever else uses that ChatGPT account.

Each sandbox then sends OpenAI traffic to the subscription until one of these happens, after which
it uses the fallback key for the rest of its life:

- usage is already at or above the ceiling when the sandbox starts. The percentage is read from
  `GET /backend-api/wham/usage`, which reports both windows without consuming any of them, so the
  first turn does not have to overshoot the ceiling to discover it
- a Codex response reports either window at or above the ceiling. On a successful response the
  in-flight reply is kept and only the next request moves over, because a started stream cannot be
  replayed
- Codex answers `429` with a quota signal: `x-codex-rate-limit-reached-type`, a usage-limit message,
  or a window at or above the ceiling. That request is retried on the fallback key immediately
- the control plane cannot mint a subscription access token at all (revoked or expired refresh
  token)

A plain `429` with no quota signal is passed through untouched, so short-window throttling does not
spend money. Both windows count: Codex tracks a short (roughly 5-hour) and a weekly window, and the
higher usage of the two decides. An unparseable ceiling is ignored with a log line and treated
as 100. If the usage probe fails, the sandbox stays on the subscription and relies on response
headers instead.

Every switch is logged in the session's sandbox logs as
`[codex-auth-plugin] spilling OpenAI traffic over to OPENAI_API_KEY_FALLBACK: <reason>`.

Two caveats: the latch lasts as long as the sandbox, so a session that spilled over stays on the key
even if the window resets under it, and OpenCode still reports OpenAI token costs as `0` because the
Codex proxy zeroes them at startup.

## How It Works (subscription path)

The OpenAI device authorization result is encrypted with `PROVIDER_ACCOUNTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the
control plane and is never exposed to the browser or sandboxes. A session stores the selected
account ID, not credential material. When the sandbox needs OpenAI access, its runtime plugin calls
the sandbox-authenticated `POST /sessions/:id/provider-auth/openai/access-token` endpoint. The
control plane refreshes and rotates the account credential and returns only short-lived access
material.

Children inherit their parent's pinned provider authentication. Disabling or archiving an account
blocks future broker calls, but an access token already issued to a running sandbox remains usable
until it expires. When an API key takes precedence, none of this applies: no sentinel, no auth proxy
plugin, and no token refresh calls.

## Deployment and Coexistence

Legacy scoped OAuth and provider accounts can coexist. Existing sessions retain their legacy
binding. Add and verify provider accounts at any time, then set a provider default when new sessions
should use that account. Defaults never move existing sessions. The settings page lists remaining
legacy OAuth key locations; remove them only after dependent legacy-bound sessions are no longer
needed. Older manually provisioned credentials continue to work, but new ChatGPT accounts should use
the first-party device authorization flow in Settings. Do not copy the same rotating refresh token
into both credential systems.

## Troubleshooting

### Model doesn't appear in the dropdown

Ensure your deployment is up to date. OpenAI model support requires the latest version of
Open-Inspect.

### Session fails to start with an OpenAI model

Confirm that the selected/default OpenAI account is active and the account is verified. If the
session explicitly uses API-key mode, confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available in its secret scope.

### "The usage limit has been reached"

The ChatGPT subscription behind `OPENAI_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` hit its Codex quota. Wait for the quota
window to reset, switch the session to a Claude model, or add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret
([Using an API key](#using-an-api-key)) to bill OpenAI usage per token instead.

### "Token refresh failed" errors

The OAuth grant may have been revoked, expired, or rotated elsewhere. Use **Reconnect** on the
existing account and complete the same device authorization flow. Reconnect preserves the account's
display name and must authenticate the same OpenAI account identity; connect a new provider account
if the identity changed.
