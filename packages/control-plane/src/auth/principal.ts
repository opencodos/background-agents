 * built the request.
 *
 * Safe methods are the default rather than a route allowlist because every
 * mutating route is already a non-GET, and an allowlist silently fails open
 * for each read route added later. Routes that want a token to write — skill
 * import, so the MCP server can create and update skills — opt in one at a
 * time through their own policy, which keeps the exceptions enumerable and
 * states them next to the permission the write already demands. The opt-in
 * narrows what a leaked token reaches to those routes; everything else stays
 * refused whoever built the request.
