# GitHub Bot

A stateless Cloudflare Worker that translates GitHub webhook events into Open-Inspect coding agent
sessions. It provides two capabilities:

1. **Code Review** — Review non-draft PRs when they open, reopen, become ready, or receive a new
   commit, then submit structured feedback.
2. **Comment-Triggered Actions** — @mention the bot in a PR comment; it reads the PR context and
   responds with analysis, a summary comment, or a review-thread reply.

For day-to-day usage, see the user-facing
[GitHub integration guide](../../docs/integrations/GITHUB.md).

The bot is a **webhook-to-session translator** — it verifies webhooks, posts a pending
`open-inspect` commit status and an acknowledgment reaction, creates a session through the control
plane, and sends a prompt. The agent in the sandbox posts the review and replaces the pending status
with a successful status linked to that review.

Webhook deliveries are deduplicated with Cloudflare KV using `X-GitHub-Delivery`, so GitHub retries
and manual redeliveries do not create duplicate sessions.

Because Cloudflare KV is eventually consistent, this is a best-effort dedupe guard rather than a
strict cross-region lock.

```

Key design decisions:

- **Results from the sandbox, endings from the control plane**: The bot calls the control plane to
  create sessions and send prompts, and the agent posts results to GitHub directly from the sandbox.
  The calls back are the control plane's `GITHUB_BOT` binding to `POST /callbacks/complete`, sent
  when a review session's turn ends, and to `POST /callbacks/review-close-out`, sent by its reaper
  to retry a close-out, so the bot can close out a status the agent never replaced (see
  [Review Close-Out](#review-close-out)).
- **No session reuse**: Every non-duplicate webhook delivery creates a fresh session. Delivery
  dedupe is handled separately in KV using `X-GitHub-Delivery`.
- **No PR context fetching**: The bot only uses metadata already in the webhook payload. The agent
  gathers additional context (diffs, prior comments, file contents) itself using `gh` CLI.

## Deployment

The bot is deployed via Terraform as a standalone Cloudflare Worker alongside the existing workers.

**Two-phase deployment** (same pattern as the Slack bot):

1. Deploy with `enable_service_bindings = false` (creates the worker)
2. Set `enable_service_bindings = true` and apply again (adds the `CONTROL_PLANE` binding, and the
   control plane's `GITHUB_BOT` binding back to this worker)

### GitHub App Configuration

The GitHub bot uses the same repository permissions configured for the main GitHub App setup. In
particular, it requires:

**Permissions**: `Commit statuses: Read & write`, `Pull requests: Read & write`,
`Issues: Read & write`

The control plane does not need Issues permission to label session-created pull requests; the
required `Pull requests: Read & write` permission authorizes those label operations. See the
[GitHub App setup](../../docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#step-3-create-github-app) for the complete
permission list.

**Event subscriptions**: `Pull request`, `Issue comment`, `Pull request review`,
`Pull request review comment`

**Webhook URL**: `https://open-inspect-github-bot-{suffix}.{account}.workers.dev/webhooks/github`

**Webhook secret**: Must match `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the Terraform configuration.

### Optional Reviewer App

GitHub refuses to let a PR author approve their own PR. To let the bot approve PRs opened by the
main App, install a second App with only **Pull requests: Read & write** (plus GitHub's mandatory
Metadata read permission), with webhooks disabled. Set `github_reviewer_username` and all three
`github_reviewer_app_*` Terraform variables together, or leave all four empty. Use the reviewer's
exact bot login, such as `my-reviewer[bot]`. See the
[two-App setup](../../docs/integrations/GITHUB.md#optional-separate-reviewer-app).

The control plane holds the reviewer's App credentials and brokers its installation token through
the sandbox-authenticated `GET /sessions/:id/review-token` route. The bot receives only
`GITHUB_REVIEWER_USERNAME`; the review's submission script fetches the token while it holds the PR's
submission lease, just before the review POST, and sets `GH_TOKEN` for that command alone. Status
writes and the lease keep their existing credential. No reviewer App means no token fetch and a
self-authored PR still gets `COMMENT`. The same self-review check applies to the reviewer App if it
authored the PR. With a reviewer login set, any token-fetch failure (including the route's 404 when
the control plane lacks some reviewer credential, or an empty token) releases the lease and writes
nothing; the review's close-out then terminalizes its pending status.

### Sandbox Prerequisites

For the agent to interact with GitHub from the sandbox, these prerequisites must be met:

1. **`gh` CLI** installed in the sandbox image (`packages/modal-infra/src/images/base.py`)
2. **Git credential helper** configured in the sandbox image/runtime so git operations can request
   short-lived SCM credentials from the control plane

Fresh and prebuilt-image sandboxes get GitHub CLI credentials through the helper rather than
spawn-time token injection. `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` env fallbacks are only used for
legacy snapshots when the user has not provided an explicit GitHub CLI token. One-shot image-build
sandboxes use only the narrower `VCS_CLONE_TOKEN` fallback because they cannot call the
control-plane credential broker. For git operations, the helper keeps the existing installation-wide
access model and can authenticate auxiliary private repos on the configured SCM host.

## Webhook Events

| Event                         | Action                                                  | Trigger                       | Handler                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `pull_request`                | `opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review` | Non-draft PR review lifecycle | `handlePullRequestReviewTrigger` |
| `pull_request`                | `review_requested`                                      | Compatibility event path      | `handleReviewRequested`          |
| `issue_comment`               | `created`                                               | @mention in a PR comment      | `handleIssueComment`             |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | `created`                                               | @mention in a review thread   | `handleReviewComment`            |

All events are processed asynchronously via `executionCtx.waitUntil()`. The webhook endpoint returns
200 immediately after signature verification and delivery dedupe.

### Handler Flows

**Pull Request Review Trigger (Auto-Review):**

1. Check `pull_request.draft` — skip draft PRs.
2. Apply the configured trigger-user gate. An event whose sender is the webhook App itself (a PR it
   opened, a push to its own branch) bypasses both caller gates: an allowlist never names the bot,
   and the collaborator-permission lookup 404s for a `[bot]` login.
3. On any action but `opened`, read the PR's reviews. If a reviewer's latest verdict is a standing
   approval, stand down and skip. First re-read the PR as step 5 does; when the head, state, or
   draft flag no longer match the event, do nothing and skip (a delayed event must not act on a
   newer head's review). Otherwise claim a generation (so no running review can take the submission
   lease again), post `success` ("Skipped — PR already approved") on the head if its status is
   pending or absent, then sweep, naming the repository, so the review of a replaced head is closed
   out under the lease. The skip is the one terminal status written without the lease; a same-head
   writer that already held the lease when the claim landed can still overwrite it. If the claim
   fails, or the head's status cannot be read or the skip written, it does not sweep and reviews as
   normal instead, releasing any claim it took first, so the head is never left without a status and
   the previous review stays eligible to publish if the fallback cannot start. An unreadable
   approval state likewise fails open and reviews as normal.
4. Post an eyes reaction on the PR.
5. Re-read the PR from GitHub and skip when the head SHA, state, or draft flag no longer match the
   webhook payload. This runs as the last step before the claim, so the narrowest possible window
   remains in which a push or close can outrank the snapshot.
6. Claim the next review generation for the PR from the control plane.
7. Create a session through the control plane, fenced on that generation. A 409 means a newer
   trigger already won, and the handler skips. Any other failure releases the claim — conditionally,
   so a newer claim is never disturbed — before rethrowing.
8. Sweep and cancel review sessions for the PR that hold an older generation, naming the repository.
   An older review whose head a push replaced keeps its fence row with a close-out request, so its
   pending status is closed out like any other ending (see [Review Close-Out](#review-close-out)).
9. Post a pending `open-inspect` status on `pull_request.head.sha`. This is the only status write
   made without the PR's submission lease.
10. Send the code review prompt. Its submission step is one shell script that first takes the PR's
    submission lease from the control plane: a 423 (another holder's lease is live) is retried for
    up to 100 seconds, and a 409 (superseded, or the turn was already closed out) exits without
    writing. Holding the lease, the script re-checks the PR; if the head, state, or draft flag
    changed, it posts `error` ("Review skipped: PR changed before submission") and stops. Otherwise
    it fetches the reviewer App's token when one is configured, posts the review, then replaces the
    status with `success` linked to that review. It releases the lease either way, and writes no
    status on any other failure: the review's close-out does. Reviews of PRs opened by whichever App
    submits them use `COMMENT`, because GitHub does not allow pull request authors to approve their
    own PRs.

If the prompt cannot be delivered, the handler requests the session's close-out itself, with "Review
failed to start" as its description. If that request cannot be recorded either, the control plane's
reaper finds the review later: the session is created with the PR's repository on its fence row, and
a latest review that has no close-out after 10 minutes gets a provisional "Review failed to start"
marker, and then its session is asked to archive itself as an unprompted draft (so no prompt can
start it). While the marker is provisional the agent's lease request gets 423 (wait), and no
close-out is granted. The marker is withdrawn if the session turns out to hold a prompt or to be
active; otherwise it becomes a close-out request and runs like any other. A lost archive answer
leaves it provisional, and the next tick asks again.

**Review Requested (compatibility path):**

This is how a person asks for a fresh review without pushing: GitHub's re-request button on a PR the
bot reviewed. When a second App submits the reviews (`GITHUB_REVIEWER_USERNAME`), GitHub lists that
App as the reviewer, so the button names it rather than the webhook App; both logins are accepted.

1. Check `requested_reviewer.login` matches `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` or `GITHUB_REVIEWER_USERNAME` —
   return early if not.
2. Post an eyes reaction on the PR.
3. Run the same freshness check, generation claim, fenced session creation (with conditional claim
   release on failure), and stale-review sweep as the auto-review path.
4. Post a pending `open-inspect` status on `pull_request.head.sha`.
5. Send the code review prompt, which posts the successful status after the review.

In both review flows, a review that ends without replacing its pending status is closed out by the
bot (see [Review Close-Out](#review-close-out)).

**Issue Comment:**

1. Check `issue.pull_request` exists — ignore non-PR comments
2. Check comment body contains `@{GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME}` — ignore if no mention
3. Check `sender.login !== GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` — prevent loops
4. Strip @mention, post eyes reaction, create session, send comment action prompt

**Review Comment:** Same as issue comment, but the prompt additionally includes `filePath`,
`diffHunk`, and `commentId` for thread-specific context and reply threading.

### Review Close-Out

Every terminal `open-inspect` status is written by the holder of its PR's submission lease: the
review's agent (its `success`, or the stale-PR `error`), or a close-out holding the lease as
`close-out:<sessionId>:<nonce>` — a fresh id per grant. A close-out replaces only a status that is
still `pending`.

A review prompt carries a `github` callback context naming the PR and the head SHA its pending
status sits on. When the session's turn ends — published, timed out as stuck, cancelled, or lost its
sandbox — the control plane signs a completion callback with this bot's `SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET` and
sends it to `POST /callbacks/complete`. The bot then:

1. Requests the close-out (`POST /internal/github-reviews/close-out`) before acknowledging, and
   answers 503 if the control plane cannot record it, so the callback is redelivered. The request is
   stored on the session's fence row; from then on the agent can no longer take the lease.
2. On `200` it holds the lease, named by the grant's `grantId`. `202` means another holder's lease
   is live, or a superseded session is not yet confirmed cancelled; `409` means nothing is owed (a
   newer review of the same head owns the status, or it was already closed out). Neither writes
   anything now: the control plane's reaper re-drives an owed close-out every minute through
   `POST /callbacks/review-close-out` until it is granted.
3. After acknowledging, it reads the commit's combined status and leaves anything but a
   still-pending `open-inspect` alone, and leaves a merged or closed PR alone.
4. Otherwise it posts `error`: "Superseded by a newer commit" for a review a push replaced;
   `Review did not finish: <the session's reason>`; or "Review did not publish" for a turn that
   ended successfully without replacing the status. It never starts that write with less than a
   request timeout plus 5 seconds of the lease left.
5. It finalizes its grant (`POST /internal/github-reviews/close-out/finalize` with the `grantId`):
   `done` once GitHub shows a terminal status, which deletes the fence row, or `retry`, which
   releases the lease and keeps the row for the reaper. A rejection GitHub can clear later — a
   timeout, a 5xx, or a rate limit (429, or 403 with rate-limit headers or message) — is `retry`;
   any other 4xx is abandoned as `done`. Either outcome acts only while that grant still holds the
   lease, so a late finalize from an earlier attempt is a no-op.

Fence rows older than a day are dropped by the reaper (unless a close-out holds the lease for them
at that moment), so a close-out that can never succeed stops being retried. A completion callback
that fails both delivery attempts is never recorded; that status stays pending.

### Session Target

Sessions are repo-bound by default: they open the webhook payload's repository. A repository can opt
into launching a saved environment instead by setting `defaultEnvironmentId` in its repo metadata
(`PUT /repos/:owner/:name/metadata` on the control plane) — a PR review or @mention on that repo
then opens the environment's full multi-repository workspace.

The environment must still contain the trigger repository — the session has to check out the PR
under review — and the sender must be authorized for the whole workspace: caller gating's semantics
extend from the trigger repo to every environment repository. An `allowedTriggerUsers` allowlist
vouches for the sender as it already does today; without one, the sender needs write permission on
each repository in the environment, so an environment launch never widens what the sender can reach.
The bot falls back to the plain repo-bound session (with a `target.*` warning log) when the metadata
or environment lookup fails, the environment was deleted, it no longer contains the trigger repo, or
the sender lacks permission on any of its repositories. Integration settings (model, enabled repos,
instructions) always resolve from the trigger repository either way.

## Authentication

### Webhook Verification

Incoming webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 with `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:

1. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw_body)`
2. Compare against `X-Hub-Signature-256` header using constant-time comparison
3. Reject with 401 on mismatch

### GitHub App Tokens

The bot generates a GitHub App installation token for posting acknowledgment reactions:

```
Private key → JWT (RS256, 10-min expiry) → Installation access token (1-hour TTL)
```

The token generation code is duplicated from the control plane (`src/auth/github-app.ts`) rather
than extracted to `@open-inspect/shared`, because it uses Cloudflare Workers' `crypto.subtle` API
for RSA key import.

### Control Plane Auth

Requests to the control plane are signed per-request with the bot's `SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET` (the
`sig1` per-service signature, same mechanism as the Slack bot). The signature binds the method, URL,
body, and asserted actor, and is sent in the `X-OpenInspect-Service-Signature` header alongside
`X-OpenInspect-Service: github-bot`.

## Prompt Construction

Two prompt templates in `src/prompts.ts`:

**`buildCodeReviewPrompt`** — Includes PR title, body, author, branches, and instructions to:

- Run `gh pr diff` for the full diff
- Submit a review via `gh api .../reviews`
- Post inline comments via `gh api .../comments`
- Emit applyable `suggestion` fences in inline comment bodies (see below)

**`buildCommentActionPrompt`** — Includes the user's request (with @mention stripped) and
instructions to:

- Check prior conversation via `gh pr view --comments`
- Make code changes and push, or respond with analysis
- Post a summary comment via `gh api .../issues/{n}/comments`
- Reply to a specific review thread (when `commentId` is present), optionally with an applyable
  `suggestion` fence — the summary comment cannot carry one, since an issue comment has no line
  anchor

### Applyable Suggestions

`buildSuggestionGuidelines` is shared by both prompts. A fenced `suggestion` block inside a
**line-anchored** comment is what GitHub renders with a "Commit suggestion" button; the fence
content replaces the anchored lines verbatim. Nothing in this package touches the GitHub API for it
— the review schema in `buildCodeReviewPrompt` already carries `path`/`line`/`side` and a
`commit_id`, so suggestions are entirely a property of each comment's `body`. The guidelines add
`start_line`/`start_side` for range anchors and hold the agent to the constraints that make an
applied suggestion safe: verbatim replacement, exact original indentation, no diff markers or
placeholders, and range endpoints that both fall inside a diff hunk (an endpoint outside the diff
rejects the whole review with HTTP 422). Because the sandbox has the head branch checked out, the
agent is required to print the anchored lines and validate the patched file before emitting a fence,
and to fall back to prose when it cannot — an applied suggestion is one click from merge.

The review path carries suggestions safely because `/tmp/review.json` is a JSON file, not a shell
argument. The thread-reply path in `buildCommentActionPrompt` therefore uses `-F body=@<file>`
rather than an inline `-f body="…"`: a fence contains backticks, and backticks inside a
double-quoted shell argument are command substitution.

The prompts embed only metadata from the webhook payload. The agent gathers everything else.

## Observability

All log entries are structured JSON with `trace_id` for cross-service correlation:

```
GitHub webhook → Bot (trace_id generated) → Control plane (trace_id in x-trace-id header) → Sandbox
```

Key log events:

| Event                            | Level | When                                          |
