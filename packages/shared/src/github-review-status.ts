 * a write from one lands beside the other's rather than replacing it: the
 * github-bot posts `pending` when a review starts and the terminal status when
 * the agent finishes, and the control plane closes out a review whose session
 * died before the agent could write anything. The context lives here because a
 * copy in each package is a string that can drift silently — the symptom being
 * a PR carrying two `open-inspect` statuses, one of them pending forever.
